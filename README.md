# Socratic-circle

Socratic Circle is a social media website for philosophers to connect and share their work. The back-end runs on Firebase. The project is written in Typescript. I used Redux and the Redux Toolkit for state management. In this project, I learned about CRUD operations as well as how authentication works.
